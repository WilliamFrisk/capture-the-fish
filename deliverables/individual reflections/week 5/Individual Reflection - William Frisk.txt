This week the workload was a little lighter. The project is almost finished with only a couple of 
small details missing. I contributed by fixing some bugs in the code for catching the fish, helping 
with writing the team reflection. Moreover I started a pull request on solving some performance 
issues.

Since we're approaching the end of the course I feel like I understand the agile workflow. Something 
I do want to learn however is what to do when the backlog starts to get empty.

I feel like the biggest improvement on my part is my contribution to the written deliverables this 
week. Throughout the project it's been quite lacking but this week I took an active part. My aim for 
next sprint is to continue with this and be a helpful team member when writing the final report and 
making the presentation video.
