This sprint was the first full length sprint for the project. I was 
product owner this sprint but I realise that I don't know really why we 
need a product owner and especially why we need a scrum master. So that's 
what I'm going to look into for next sprint to help improve our teams 
agile process.

This week I developed a backend for the JSON database for our quiz 
questions. Furthermore I did what I aimed to do in last week's reflection 
and learned more about libGDX and used that knowledge to set up a way to unit
test our code in the future to ensure code quality.

I got more involved in our project scope this week through being the 
product owner but still have a ways to go until I reach the stage of 
involvement I want to be at.
