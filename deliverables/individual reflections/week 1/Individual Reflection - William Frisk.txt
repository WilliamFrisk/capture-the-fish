This sprint was shorter than coming sprints because of the Easter holidays 
so I didn't achieve as much as I want to in the future. My focus right now 
is getting a deeper understanding of libGDX which is the java library 
we're using to develop our game. 

This sprint my contributions were mainly 
technical. I developed a first, very simple, draft of our game. I also 
helped start building our system design using a UML diagram.

I feel like I can provide a lot of technical expertise to the group so that is what I 
aim to do over the coming sprint. However I do feel like I'm not as 
engaged in the overall project scope as I could be so that is an area in 
which I can improve over the coming sprint.
